int skip_eol(char *a)
  use memchr to find first newline 
  occurence, position specifically

horizontal cursor position:
count how many characters you 
are out from the last newline 
(only fire on up down movements)

vertical cursor position:
count how many newlines there are
from the start of the buffer to the
end
(only fire on up down movements)

going up:
if you go up to a line with less characters
than the current horizontal position, then
clamp the horizontal position to the line, 
and vice versa

check if file has lines longer than 65536 bytes
if no - line lengths are u shorts
if yes - line lengths are u ints

modes:

real terminal
